# Grammatical Framework (GF)

![Build majestic runtime](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core/actions/workflows/build-majestic.yml/badge.svg?branch=majestic)

The Grammatical Framework is a grammar formalism based on type theory.
It consists of:

- a special-purpose programming language
- a compiler of the language
- a generic grammar processor

The compiler reads GF grammars from user-provided files, and the
generic grammar processor performs various tasks with the grammars:

- generation
- parsing
- translation
- type checking
- computation
- paraphrasing
- random generation
- syntax editing

GF particularly addresses four aspects of grammars:

- multilinguality (parallel grammars for different languages)
- semantics (semantic conditions of well-formedness, semantic properties of expressions)
- grammar engineering (modularity, abstractions, libraries)
- embeddability in programs written in other languages (C, C++, Haskell, Java, JavaScript)

## Compilation and installation

The simplest way of installing GF from source is with the command:
```
cabal install
```
or:
```
stack install
```
Note that if you are unlucky to have Cabal 3.0 or later, then it uses
the so-called Nix style commands. Using those for GF development is
a pain. Every time when you change something in the source code, Cabal
will generate a new folder for GF to look for the GF libraries and
the GF cloud. Either reinstall everything with every change in the
compiler, or be sane and stop using cabal-install. Instead you can do:
```
runghc Setup.hs configure
runghc Setup.hs build
sudo runghc Setup.hs install
```
The script will install the GF dependencies globally. The only solution
to the Nix madness that I found is radical:

  "No person, no problem" (Нет человека – нет проблемы).

## About this repository

On 2018-07-25, the monolithic [GF repository](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF)
was split in two:

1. [gf-core](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core) —  the GF compiler, shell and runtimes
2. [gf-rgl](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl) — the resource grammar library

The former repository is now archived and no longer updated.
The split was performed using [this script](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF/blob/30ae1b5a5f73513ac5825ca6712186ef8afe9fd4/split/run.sh)
and the output of that script is [here](https://gist.github.com/johnjcamilleri/a6c43ff61f15a9657b457ac94ab7db61).
