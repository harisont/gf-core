/*
   Bins
    An array of bin headers for free chunks. Each bin is doubly
    linked.  The bins are approximately proportionally (log) spaced.
    There are a lot of these bins (128). This may look excessive, but
    works very well in practice.  Most bins hold sizes that are
    unusual as allocation request sizes, but are more usual for fragments
    and consolidated sets of chunks, which is what these bins hold, so
    they can be found quickly.  All procedures maintain the invariant
    that no consolidated chunk physically borders another one, so each
    chunk in a list is known to be preceeded and followed by either
    inuse chunks or the ends of memory.
    Chunks in bins are kept in size order, with ties going to the
    approximately least recently used chunk. Ordering isn't needed
    for the small bins, which all contain the same-sized chunks, but
    facilitates best-fit allocation for larger chunks. These lists
    are just sequential. Keeping them in order almost never requires
    enough traversal to warrant using fancier ordered data
    structures.
    Chunks of the same size are linked with the most
    recently freed at the front, and allocations are taken from the
    back.  This results in LRU (FIFO) allocation order, which tends
    to give each chunk an equal opportunity to be consolidated with
    adjacent freed chunks, resulting in larger free chunks and less
    fragmentation.
    To simplify use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts
    as an mchunk. This avoids special-casing for headers.
    But to conserve space and improve locality, we allocate
    only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use repositioning tricks
    to treat these as the fields of a mchunk*.

   Indexing
    Bins for sizes < 512 bytes contain chunks of all the same size, spaced
    8 bytes apart. Larger bins are approximately logarithmically spaced:
    64 bins of size       8
    32 bins of size      64
    16 bins of size     512
     8 bins of size    4096

     2 bins of size  262144
     1 bin  of size what's left
    There is actually a little bit of slop in the numbers in bin_index
    for the sake of speed. This makes no difference elsewhere.
    The bins top out around 1MB because we expect to service large
    requests via mmap.
    Bin 0 does not exist.  Bin 1 is the unordered list; if that would be
    a valid chunk size the small bins are bumped up one.
